===========================================

This repository contains personal projects that relate to the topics of data science, machine learning, big data and AI. Primarily, this repository serves to store my personal work, but I would also like to give third parties an insight into my work. Please always keep in mind that this is a living project, which will be updated from time to time, depending on my time. 

The basis for these projects is the bootcamp in Data Science and AI that I completed in London, but I need and want to continue practising.

Content:

- [01_NLP](/01_NLP_hotel_review/BM_NLP_hotel_review.ipynb)
    In this project I am building a prediction algorithm that predicts the general sentiment of the comment based on a dataset of hotel reviews.  

- [02_Big_Data](/02_Big_Data/)
    This project is more about the general setups of the AWS EMR and working in it via an SSH - the actual work is extremely simplified. 

- [03_LEGO_hackathon](/03_LEGO_Hackathon/README.md)
    This is a hackathon that my team and I finished as the winning team within 24 hours. The aim was to suggest improvements to a The LEGO Group website application 

- [04_time_series_outlier_detection_and_quantification](https://github.com/bennymiddel/time_series_project)
    In this project, I use the machine learning models SARIMAX and XGBoost to detect, define and quantify price anomalies in electricity prices between 2021 and 2024. The final model is an XGBoost regression with parameters based on cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning.

- [05_image_recognition](/05_image_recognition/)
    (on going) In this project I would like to build an image recognition system that makes it possible to recognise objects. Depending on time, I will make progress. I will also use this project to maintain my skills in Python with all its libraries and push this further alongside my application process.
