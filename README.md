## Projects - Benedikt Middelstaedt
===========================================

This repository contains personal projects that relate to the topics of data science, machine learning, big data and AI. Primarily, this repository serves to store my personal work, but I would also like to give third parties an insight into my work. Please always keep in mind that this is a living project, which will be updated from time to time, depending on time. 

The basis for these projects is the bootcamp in Data Science and AI that I completed in London, but I need and want to continue practising.
