===========================================

This repository contains personal projects that relate to the topics of data science, machine learning, big data and AI. Primarily, this repository serves to store my personal work, but I would also like to give third parties an insight into my work. Please always keep in mind that this is a living project, which will be updated from time to time, depending on my time. 

The basis for these projects is the bootcamp in Data Science and AI that I completed in London, but I need and want to continue practising.

Content:

- [01_NLP](/01_NLP_hotel_review/BM_NLP_hotel_review.ipynb)
    In this project I am building a prediction algorithm that predicts the general sentiment of the comment based on a dataset of hotel reviews.  

- [02_Big_Data](/02_Big_Data/)
    This project is more about the general setups of the AWS EMR and working in it via an SSH - the actual work is extremely simplified. 

- [03_LEGO_hackathon](/03_LEGO_Hackathon/README.md)
    This is a hackathon that my team and I finished as the winning team within 24 hours. The aim was to suggest improvements to a The LEGO Group website application
