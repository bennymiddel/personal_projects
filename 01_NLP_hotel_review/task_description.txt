Task NLP With Hotel Review:

DUE DATE: 10th of June 2024 


data set consisting of hotel reviews 
-text fields for positive and negative comments 
-details about the stay (hotel location, time & length of stay, etc).
-target column of interest is ####Reviewer_Score#### -binary
(positive sentiment as 1 and negative as 0)

------------------------------------------
###Requirements
------------------------------------------

Please submit your Jupyter notebook which should include
commented code and extensive markdown cells explaining your process and insights. 
Make sure to add a:
    -table of contents, 
    -introduction, 
    -proper section headers and 
    -a conclusion section. 
    
Your communication in the markdown cells and the code cell outputs
should allow anyone to understand your process and findings without the need to read the code.

###Exploratory Data Analysis
------------------------------------------
First, let's load the data and understand what we are working with.

1. Perform EDA on the data and mention 3-4 observations from which you
can draw actionable insights. In your EDA, you may consider creating
a data dictionary, basic statistical analysis, data visualizations, 
data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling.

------------------------------------------
###Preprocessing
------------------------------------------

2. Split the data into train and test sets and transform the positive
and negative review columns using a CountVectorizer. 
Consider the following:
    -What tokenizer and text cleaning steps do you include?
    -Using the vectorizer, maximize the number of features at 500
    and make sure that tokens used <10 times are dropped from the vocabulary.

This process may be done on the positive and negative review columns separately
and then the resulting arrays merged with the original numeric features to form
the final train and test data frames ready for modelling. In your column names,
make sure you mark which words are coming from the positive vs negative reviews 
(you can use a prefix such as pos_ and neg_).

------------------------------------------
###Modelling
------------------------------------------

As the data is now ready for modelling, we will be creating two separate models
 with optimization and evaluation of each.

3. Fit a logistic regression model on the data and analyze the test 
and train accuracy. Find the top 20 words from the positive reviews that are
most predictive of a positive sentiment (Reviewer_Score = 1). Similarly, find
the top 20 words from the negative reviews that are most predictive of a negative
sentiment (Reviewer_Score = 0). What actionable insights can you draw from these?

4. Using a pipeline, combine PCA with a decision tree classifier.

    -Optimize at least 3 hyperparameters including the maximum tree depth and
    the minimum number of data points required on each leaf node.
    -You can use 20 principle components.
    -The best parameters should be found using 5-fold cross validation.

Contrast the best results here with the logistic regression model and provide
any insights that you may draw from the results.

5. For your best performing model, conduct a more in-depth evaluation by
analyzing the confusion matrix and commenting on the model errors and metrics
such as precision and recall.
